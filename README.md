# Palladium Games

## Our Purpose
Our purpose is to provide gaming fun to everybody who is probably sitting bored in a classroom while their teacher drones on about the Civil War.
We have games, AI, and a proxy will be coming soon!

## Our Tech Infrastructure
We use games from [GN-MATH](https://gn-math.dev), and the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org)

## Deployment
There are many ways to deploy a Palladium Games website. Here's how:

### Free Services (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/Palladium-Games/Palladium-Games)
[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FPalladium-Games%2FPalladium-Games)  
You can also remix this on [Replit](https://replit.com/@sethpanng/Palladium-Games)



  1. Create a new project
  2. Point it to https://github.com/Palladium-Games/Palladium-Games
  3. Create it
  4. You're ready to go! Netlify/Vercel/whatever will keep the links updated to this branch.


### Actual Hosting (yay)
  1. Run ```git clone https://github.com/Palladium-Games/Palladium-Games.git```
  2. Configure your web server to serve the files in the Palladium Games folder
  3. You're good to go! Remember to run ```git pull origin main``` sometimes to keep your link updated.

## Local Game Hosting
The frontend now commits the playable game files, SWFs, thumbnails, and a generated catalog manifest directly into this repo so a blocked `api.sethpang.com` domain does not take the whole games page down.

Refresh those bundled assets from a sibling backend checkout with:

```bash
npm run sync:games
```

Verify the static catalog wiring with:

```bash
npm test
```

The sync script looks for `../palladium-backend` first and then `../backend`.
